What is software developing 

Introduction
In the industrial environment of software development, a project is seldom developed by one or two developers.  The size of the team can vary based on the size of the project.  There are many problems that can arise when working in teams. But to talk about the problems that can arise we have to first dissect the makeup of a software project and in thus the organisation of the team. A software project can have different parts to it. For example, a website that stores data has at least 3 parts: Front end middle ware and backend and event theses sections can be divided into smaller sub groups. The front end could be made up of designer and developer. All these different slices of a software project will have different members of the team working on it.  This is where we have to ask ourselves how a team can collaborate efficiently due to many circumstances  










What is version control software?
The Basics:
The very basic concept of a version control system gives the user of the system the capacity to save files or documents and give the ability to keep track of modifications done to that file. Version control systems use repositories to give us the capability to track saved individual files and the modification history associated to these. From the past modifications done to files we can see the progress of projects and the present state of the Repositories. Following the modifications to a repository enables users to evaluate the decisions made for a project. Since version control tracks the changes exactly it enables the user to go back to a previous version of the repository state.
For this article the most highlighted feature of a version control system is the advantages it brings to a team working on the same repository. Many contributions can be made by many different users to one repository at the same time.
